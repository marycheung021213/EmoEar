# EmoEar
**Interactive Device for Emotion Detecting**

"EmoEar" is a wearable interactive device based on Arduino. It is a cat ear headband that responds to the wearer's heart rate. It can detect the wearer's pulse and display it in realtime through the colors of LED lights and the movement of servos. This project won the third prize in the National College Students 3S IoT Competition in 2022. It is the repository for the source code.
